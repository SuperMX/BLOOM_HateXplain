# BLOOM_HateXplain
Predicting hate and rationales via the language model [BLOOM](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/bloom)
## About this repository
This notebook shows how BLOOM can be used to detect hateful content (some examples taken from [HateXplain](https://github.com/hate-alert/HateXplain)) via the [Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api). Thanks to [Sentdex](https://github.com/Sentdex/BLOOM_Examples) for showing how to call BLOOM.
Models are also available as [downloads](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bloom) (check the size!). The model can also be tried out [interactively](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface/bloom_demo). For more technical information about the model, check out this [blogpost](https://huggingface.co/blog/bloom-megatron-deepspeed).
